# Hi, I’m Cathy — Ma Folie Jewelry Studio

I’m a GIA-trained jewelry designer in Vancouver. At Ma Folie, I create custom and made-to-order engagement rings with sapphires, lab & natural diamonds, and rare gemstones — each piece designed from scratch around your story.

## Diamond basics (the 4 C’s in plain English)

- **Colour (D–Z):** D–F look colourless; G–I are “near-colourless” and great value once set.  
- **Clarity:** VVS and VS have tiny inclusions you won’t see without magnification; SI can show small inclusions but often still look beautiful face-up.  
- **Cut:** The spark factor. A well-cut diamond returns light and looks lively even if the carat is modest.  
- **Carat:** Weight, not size. A smaller well-cut stone can out-shine a larger poorly-cut one.

*At Ma Folie, our lab diamonds are typically **DEF** colour and **VVS/VS** clarity for a crisp, bright look.*

## Why sapphires make wonderful engagement stones

- **Meaningful:** Often associated with wisdom, loyalty, clarity, and sincerity.  
- **Durable:** Hardness **9** on the Mohs scale — excellent for everyday wear.  
- **Distinctive:** Not just blue — gorgeous pinks, greens, teal-greens, and more.  
- **Expressive:** A great choice if you want something unique that still feels timeless.

## Choosing a centre stone: quick cheat sheet

- **Sapphire (Mohs 9):** Rich colours, durable, symbolic; great daily wear.  
- **Ruby (Mohs 9):** Bold red, rare, romantic; stands up to life’s knocks.  
- **Diamond (Mohs 10):** Maximum hardness, classic brilliance, endless shapes.  
- **Emerald (Mohs ~7.5–8):** Lush green, refined; needs a bit more care and mindful wear.

> Hardness = scratch resistance. All stones benefit from gentle care (see below).

## Ring care (quick tips)

- Remove your ring for the gym, heavy lifting, chlorine pools, and harsh cleaners.  
- At home: soft brush + mild soap + warm water, then pat dry with a lint-free cloth.  
- Store separately in a pouch or ring box to avoid scratches.  
- Professional clean & prong check every **6–12 months**.

## The studio

- By-appointment consultations in a cozy heritage space (most weekends + one weekday).  
- You hand-pick stones; we design every detail together.  
- Typical timeline: **~6–8 weeks** from deposit to finished ring.
