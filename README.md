# Hi, I’m Cathy — Ma Folie Jewelry Studio

GIA-trained jewelry designer in Vancouver. I create custom and made-to-order engagement rings with sapphires, lab & natural diamonds, and rare gemstones — each piece designed from scratch around your story.

## Ring care (quick tips)
- Remove your ring for the gym, heavy lifting, chlorine pools, and harsh cleaners.
- At home: soft brush + mild soap + warm water, then pat dry with a lint-free cloth.
- Store separately in a pouch or ring box to avoid scratches.
- Book professional cleaning & prong checks every 6–12 months.

## The studio
- By-appointment consultations in a cozy heritage studio (most weekends + one weekday)
- Stones we love: teal/green/pink sapphires, lab & natural diamonds, select rare gems
- Typical timeline: ~6–8 weeks from deposit to finished ring
